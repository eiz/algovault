some trash.

Algorand is a TIS-100'd af implementation of smart contracts, so I wrote a
couple of rube goldberg solutions to what should have been very basic problems.

`naming.py` implements a way of doing name lookup with attached data (2048 bytes
max).

`subscription.py` implements the core primitives for a subscription payments
system.

`qvote_counterexample.py` breaks the voting system I found as the first Google
result when looking for a voting system.
